The Site, Apps, and any of our additional services will never knowingly accept, collect, maintain or use any information from a child under the age of thirteen (13).

                        <h4 class="title-small blue">Security precautions</h4>
                        <p>The Company takes commercially reasonable precautions to protect data and information under its control from misuse, loss or alteration. Unfortunately, no system can ensure complete security, and Company disclaims any liability resulting from use of the Site and Apps. If you have any questions about the security at our Site, please send an e-mail to friends@samepinch.co.</p>
                        <h4 class="title-small blue">Notification of changes to our privacy policy</h4>
                        <p>We reserve the right to change or modify our information collection, use and disclosure practices set forth in this Privacy Policy. If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on the Site so our users and customers are always aware of what information we collect, use and disclose. If at any point we decide to use or disclose your personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify you in writing, which may or may not be by e-mail. If you object to the change to our Privacy Policy, then you must contact us using the information provided in the notice. We will otherwise use and disclose a user’s or a customer’s personally identifiable information in accordance with the Privacy Policy that was in effect when such information was collected.</p>

                        <p>If the Company experiences a “change in control” (defined below), then we may amend our information practices as described in this Privacy Policy. We will disclose your personally identifiable information to the company or other legal entity that succeeds our operation of the Site or Apps. The privacy policy of the succeeding legal entity will then govern the personally identifiable information that we have collected from you under this Privacy Policy. However, if applicable law prohibits the succeeding legal entity’s privacy policy from governing your personally identifiable information, then this Privacy Policy shall continue to govern.</p>
                        <p>“Change in control” means any of the following events:</p>

                            <li>we become subject to any proceedings under any bankruptcy or insolvency law, whether domestic or foreign; or</li>
